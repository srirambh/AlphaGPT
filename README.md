## What is the name of your App?
AlphaGPT

<br /><br />
## What does your app do?
*Describe in a paragraph or so*

Our project is an advanced ChatGPT wrapper that allows users to provide complex tasks to ChatGPT and receive a solution, as opposed to a redundant breakdown of the task. We are creating sessions for each type of targeted task, such as coding a complex project or summarizing a very long book, etc, so that users may interact in depth with our app. Our product involves a variety of technologies, such as Kubernetes, Docker, React, Python, Flask, RabbitMQ, Langchain, and others.
