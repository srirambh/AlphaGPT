AlphaGPT

## What does your app do?
*Describe in a paragraph or so*

Our app is a GPT wrapper designed to return what would be your ideal response to GPT when inputting a complicated task. Rather than GPT returning to you a breakdown of the task into subtasks, it will return to you everything you intended when you ask the question.
